            <p class=TextWrapTextye>From a young age, I was always drawn to clothing. I remember being in elementary school, loving the feeling that my first pair of vans old schools gave me. At that time the shoe was unique, none of my friends had a pair. I discovered a form of expression that I didn't have before. <br><br>From there my interest in clothing began. I was drawn to graphic tees and hoodies, a form of clothing I still enjoy to this day. I started keeping track of different clothing subcultures, though mainly the culture that was brought on through rap group 'Odd Future'. Once I got a  entered highschool, I was enamored by the 'streetwear' subculture, and became pretty invested in it. <br><br> At this point I was mainly a consumer of clothing. I had a good eye for things and could put on a nice outfit, and felt pretty satisfied with that. On any given day I could exude a certain 'vibe' just through the clothes I wore.<br><br> </p>

                However, right before I began university, a close friend of mine passed away. I began thinking of meaning, purpose, life, and death. This line of thinking made me realize that I wasnt really doing anything other than completing school work, playing video games, and hanging out with friends. Not to say that those things arent good - I just felt like something was missing.<br><br> A void began to grow out of a percieved lack of meaning and purpose. This continued for nearly a year.  <br><br> One day I suddenly felt the urge to create something... anything. This urge was deep, and all encompassing in my daily life. I couldnt get away from it. Following this urge, I eventually opened up Adobe Photoshop. I had it on my MacBook due to a course I took, but had never really used it for anything outside of school. <br><br> I began creating artwork specifically catered towards clothing. It wasn't very good at first, though I stuck with it. It became clear to me that the void within me was being remedied by the act of creation. From this realization, I became somewhat obsessed with creating artwork. 
                
                <br><br> Nowadays, I run a clothing business called 'Grey Garden' alongside two people of whom I hold dearly. I'm about to recieve my undergraduate degree at the University of Waterloo (Global Business and Digital Arts). I'm both anxious and excited about the new chapter of life I'm about to embark on. <br><br>Artwork is something that I know will stick with me for years to come - Its been nearly 3 years since I began creating, but I still feel that sense of remedy when I make something. I'm excited to sharpen my craft, and to continue creating products and artwork as my life goes on.<br><br> Outside of artwork, I hold interest in product design, video games, and good conversations. I'm drawn to the unique challenges each of these interests bring me. I feel lucky to have experienced the Global Business and Digital Arts program at the University of Waterloo, as it introduced me to product design, a discipline that I didnt know existed prior. I'm particularly drawn to the aspects of team-work, technical skills, and human interaction that product design holds. I'm excited to learn more about it as my life continues. <br><br> If you've made it this far, thanks for reading... that was a lot of text.
